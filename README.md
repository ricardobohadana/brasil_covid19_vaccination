# Analysis and Prediction of the Progress of COVID-19 Vaccination in Brazil 

<b>R analysis of the on going COVID-19 vaccination progress in Brazil.</b>

What does the R script do?
- Downloads the .csv files from the following dataset from kaggle: <i>https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress</i>
- Plot 1: Number of daily vaccines applied per day since the start of vaccination in Brazil (bar plot)
- Plot 2: Total percentage of the Brazilian Population who already received (at least) the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination per day (bar plot). It also extrapolates the percentage of people vaccinated until it reaches 100% of the population, exposing the amount of days remaining to get there and how long it took since day 1.
- Plot 3 (Commented): Same as Plot 2, but with a different style (scatter plot)
